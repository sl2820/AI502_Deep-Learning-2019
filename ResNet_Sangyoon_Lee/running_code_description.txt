Running instruction

Models are defined in either 1) resnet_model.py or 2) plain_model.py
All experimented models (plain_32, plain_56, resnet_20, resnet_32, resnet_56, resnet_110) defined as a function in either python file above. 

To train, run train.py.
In train.py, you can change the possible models by giving a model name as a parameter in line 161.
    Ex)    run = Runner("resnet")# POSSIBLE MODEL ENTRY: plain, deep_plain, shallow, resnet, deeper, deep

Each running consists of 5 runs of newly initialized model each. 
Final display will show:
1) Name of Model, 
2) # of Parameters,
Train and Test:
3) Best Accuracy, 
4) Average Accuracy, 
5) STD
